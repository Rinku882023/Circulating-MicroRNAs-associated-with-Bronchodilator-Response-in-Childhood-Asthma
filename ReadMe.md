### Circulating MicroRNAs associated with Bronchodilator Response in Childhood Asthma


**Summary**

**"Circulating MicroRNAs associated with Bronchodilator Response in Childhood Asthma" (Submitted: under Review)**

Small RNA was sequenced from banked peripheral blood serum from 1,134 asthmatic children aged 6 to 14 years who participated in the Genetics of Asthma in Costa Rica Study (GACRS) (GEO Accession No: GSE244573). We filtered the participants into high and low bronchodilator response (BDR) quartiles and used DeSeq2 to identify miRNAs with differential expression (DE) in high (N= 277) vs low (N= 278) BDR group. The putative target genes of DE miRNAs were identified, and pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Results: We identified 10 down-regulated miRNAs having odds ratios (OR) between 0.37 and 0.76 for a doubling of miRNA counts and one up-regulated miRNA (OR=2.26) between high and low BDR group. Further, functional annotation of 11 DE miRNAs were performed as well as of two replicated miRs. Target genes of these miRs were enriched in regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by SREBPs, ESR-mediated signaling, G1/S transition, RHO GTPase cycle, and signaling by TGFB family pathways.
